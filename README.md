## Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

Welcome to this week's Challenge! This is an even-numbered week, so you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll create a web application from scratch! This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses.

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can't be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

With these points in mind, in this Challenge you'll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: 

- flexbox
- media queries
- CSS variables 
- link in JS file as of January 2023.

Note: If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.

## User Story
AS AN employer I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work...

* Finished: I enclosed my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, Linkedin, and how to contact me.

* Finished: I used anchor tags to make the UI scroll to the corresponding section on the page.

* Finished: I linked my JS file into the index.html file.

* Finished: I added HTML semantic tags to the index.html file for accessibility.

## Unfulfilled Criteria

* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
