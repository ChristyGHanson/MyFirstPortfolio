## Description

This is my web portfolio I am building from scratch! I am adding to it as the UW Bootcamp course progresses.

This portfolio of work will showcase my skills and talents to future employers.

I am applying these core skills:

* Bulma
* Flexbox
* Font Awesome
* media queries
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Note: If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.

## User Story
Employers want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that they can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work...

* Finished: I enclosed my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, Linkedin, and how to contact me.

* Finished: I used anchor tags to make the UI scroll to the corresponding section on the page.

* Finished: I linked my JS file into the index.html file.

* Finished: I added HTML semantic tags to the index.html file for accessibility.

## Unfulfilled Criteria

* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
